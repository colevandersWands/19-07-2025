With HTML & CSS it's enough\nto learn what goes in and what comes out, you don't need to know what happens in\nbetween:\n\n- HTML/CSS goes into a browser -> ... ? ... -> a website is displayed\n\nWith JavaScript it's the complete opposite. What the program _does_ (inputs ->\noutputs) is less important than _how it happens_. Your goal now isn't to amaze\nthe user, it's to become the computer and understand what happens between the\ninput and the output:\n\n- source code -> **a lot of important steps** -> final output\n\n## Computer Empathy\n\nA program is just a series of instructions. If you follow the instructions\n_exactly_ like the computer would, you are actually running the program by hand!\n(just a lot slower.) There is no difference in theory between you following the\ncode's instructions and a computer following the same instructions.\n\nSo when you practice tracing think of it as building your _computer empathy_:\nunderstanding what it's like to be the computer as it runs your program. If the\nfirst rule in design is \"know your user\", then one of the first rule in coding\nshould be \"know your computer\". After all, the computer is one of your code's\nusers!\n\n## Predict, not Explain\n\nSo what does it mean to \"know JavaScript\"? How do you know when you've\nunderstood some code? When you can **predict** _exactly_ what will happen at\neach step of execution!\n\nExplaining a program in plain english is helpful but it's easy to be a little\nbit wrong and not know it. When you focus on _predicting_ what happens at each\nstep and you check your predictions with a trace or JS Tutor, then you really\nknow if you understood.\n\nThis approach is also helpful because not only will you know if you're right,\nbut if you're wrong the computer will tell you the right answer! Then you know\nexactly which line you didn't understand, and you know what to study next.\n\n---\n\n## Programs: The Computer\n\nThe computer is in the center of this diagram.

It's also a lot of other things, but this\nintroduction will focus on the different ways you communicate with your code.\n\nWhen you write code you are really just writing a text document, exactly like\nyou might write an email or a note. The biggest difference between an email and\na computer program is _who you are writing for_.\n\nWhen you write an email you're writing for the person who will be reading it.\nWhen you write a computer program you are writing for 3 very different audiences\nat the same time! One single document (your code) needs to be understandable to:\n\n- **Developers**: A developer needs to read your code and understand what you\n  were trying to do and why.\n- **Computers**: Your code needs to have _perfect_ syntax so the computer can\n  parse it, and you must write instructions that are allowed by the programming\n  language or the computer will throw an error.\n- **Users**: The instructions you give to the computer must create an intuitive\n  and pleasant experience for the user.\n\nBeing a developer means understanding how all these characters interact, and\nthen communicating with everyone involved to deliver quality software within\nyour project's constraints. This diagram shows the different channels of\ncommunication in a software project:\n\n![rhetorical situation](../assets/the-big-picture.png)\n\n---\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nHigh-level programming languages like JavaScript are a compromise between how\npeople think and how a computer works. Programming languages are not always easy\nfor people to learn but they're definitely easier than directly telling a\ncomputer what to do (writing 1's and 0's).\n\nBecause humans are so much better at learning and understanding than computers\nare (for now), programming languages have been designed to leave all the hard\nwork for us. It's our job to make sure our instructions for the computer are\nperfectly structured and do exactly what we want. The computer just _parses_\n(interprets) our code and follows the instructions without any understanding or\nthinking.\n\nYou can think of a programming language as the developer's UI for the computer.\nBecause this UI isn't very intuitive you will need to spend a lot of time\nstudying syntax and other details before you can program with ease. This is why\nyou will be focusing on _understanding_ programs before writing them.\n\n[**_Learnable Programming_**](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) said\nit best:\n\n> - **Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill**. Learning about \"for\"\n>   loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is\n>   learning to draw.\n> - **People understand what they can see**. If a programmer cannot see what a\n>   program is doing, she can't understand it.\n>\n> Thus, the goals of a programming system should be:\n>\n> - to support and encourage powerful ways of thinking\n> - to enable programmers to see and understand the execution of their programs\n>\n> ...\n>\n> _How do we get people to understand programming?_\n>\n> We change programming. We turn it into something that's understandable by\n> people.\n\nUntil the future when computers are designed to understand us, we're stuck with\nprogramming systems where we do the hard work of understand computers. Hopefully\nWelcome to JS & Study Lenses can make this journey easier.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-programming)\n- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro)\n- [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AImF__7FyzM)\n- [Practical Introduction to JS](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/practical-introduction-to-javascript/content/what-is-programming/)\n"},{"name":"gen-ai-in-the-mix.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"gen-ai-in-the-mix","dir":"1-what-is-programming","path":"/1-what-is-programming/gen-ai-in-the-mix.md","lang":".md","content":"# Generative AI in the Mix\n\nThroughout this chapter you learned to think of software development as writing\none text (your source code) for three different audiences.

All these\ndevelopers pushed the limits of JavaScript, created new tooling, different\nconventions, and generally made the JS ecosystem a fascinating (and\nfrustrating!) place to work.

Backwards Compatibility means that any program ever written in\nJavaScript must _always_ work!\n\nAny time something is added to JavaScript or the language is changed in any way,\nolder programs must still be valid JavaScript. This is important because people\nhave been websites for decades now. It would be bad if one day every website\nwritten before 2003 no longer worked because of a recent change in JavaScript.\n\nImagine if every word, sentence, and grammar in your native language's history\nneeded to be understood by every native speaker for the rest of eternity! You\nwould need to be just as comfortable reading a story written 4000 years ago as\none written yesterday. This would make it very hard for languages to change and\ngrow, but this is the case for JavaScript.\n\n- [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/ch1.md#backwards--forwards)\n- [Why is JavaScript backwards compatible to a fault?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4937245/why-is-javascript-backwards-compatible-to-a-fault)\n- [tonsky.me](https://tonsky.me/blog/compatibility/)\n- [rohitdhatrak](https://www.rohitdhatrak.com/backwards-forwards-compatibility/)\n- [Chrome Breaks the Web](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/04/chrome_breaks_web/)\n\n## ES6rohitdhatrak\n\nES6 was a new version of JavaScript released in 2015, it contained major changes\nto the language that improved the developer experience. ES6 marked such a large\nchange in JavaScript that it's fair to talk about the JS world before ES6 and\nafter ES6 as different eras.\n\nYou can learn more about ES6 another time, for now you just need to know it was\nsuch a big improvement that it belongs in every history of JS.\n\n## The Future of JavaScript\n\nAll new features for the JavaScript language are presented and discussed in the\n[tc39 github organization](https://github.com/tc39). If you're curious looking\nthrough the [proposals repository](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) can be\ninteresting to see how people plan and discuss additions to the JS language.\n"},{"name":"javascript.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"javascript","dir":"1-what-is-programming","path":"/1-what-is-programming/javascript.md","lang":".md","content":"# JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the only programming language supported by web browsers, this\nmakes is a very common language. Every website that needs interactivity uses\nJavaScript alongside HTML & CSS. Because people across the world with all levels\nof programming experience are writing web pages, JavaScript has become something\nlike the English of programming languages:\n\n- It's everywhere, most developers will know at least a little bit of\n  JavaScript.\n- It's a messy and complicated language, full of exceptions and concepts\n  borrowed from other languages.\n- It's easy enough to get started with the basics, and without too much\n  experience you can already get your ideas across.\n\nSo why learn JavaScript? Because it's quick to get started, you can do a lot\nwith it, and there's lots of work for a good JavaScript developer.\n\n---\n\n## Running JavaScript\n\nThere are many ways you can run JavaScript, for now you should know about these\noptions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Writing directly in the console\n\n> This is closest to how you will be studying JS in this module.\n\nWriting JS in your browser's console is the simplest and quickest way to run\nsome JavaScript, but is limited. It's perfect for doing little experiments to\nsee how something works, but it's not possible to write and save a full program.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Try copy-pasting this code into your browser's console and pressing \"enter\"</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n/* --- for the computer --- */\n'use strict';\n\n/* --- for the developer --- */\n\n// log to the console for developers to read\nconsole.log('hello developer (console)');\n\n/* --- for the user --- */\n\n// alert hello for the user\n//  not a great UX, but easy to program\n//  you'll use this for now\nalert('hello user (alert)');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### 2. Writing directly in an HTML file\n\nYou can also write your code in a script tag of an HTML file then open the HTML\nfile in your browser. The JavaScript will run automatically when the page is\nloaded. See this in action with `./1-inline-script-tag.html`.\n\nYou will learn about this later in the course for examples and exercises that\nintroduce how JavaScript interacts with the DOM. It's easier to understand \"the\nbig picture\" when you can see everything in one document.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Loading JS files into HTML\n\nYou can also write your code in a separate `.js` file, then load the file into\nyour HTML to execute the code. There are two different ways you can load a `.js`\nfile into your HTML, you can see them in action with `./2-separate-script-file`\nand `./3-separate-module-files` (you'll learn more about scripts vs. modules\nlater on).\n\nYou will use this for larger projects and for collaboration. Separating code\ninto smaller files each with a clear purpose makes your code base easier to\nunderstand, debug, and to divide into group tasks.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Specialized Browser Environments\n\nThere are also many specialized environments for writing and running JavaScript\nin a browser, each one has a specific use case:\n\n- **Study Lenses**: This is an environment specialized for studying JavaScript\n  locally with your text editor and a browser. It has features for understanding\n  different aspects of code and for visualizing what happens during execution.\n  The \"run\" and \"debug\" buttons in Study Lenses execute your code directly in\n  the browser just like if you loaded a script into an HTML file. This will help\n  you learn your browser's DevTools and help you eventually transition away from\n  the learning environment and towards professional devtools. (_the material in\n  this repo is written for Study Lenses_)\n- **Online IDEs**: There are many online IDEs (Integrated Development\n  Environments) designed for easy setup, collaboration, and sharing. Online IDEs\n  try to match the developer experience of working on your local machine, but\n  online. These are easy to use, but they're not beginner toys! You can use\n  these to develop full projects with a wide variety of programming languages,\n  libraries and frameworks. Some popular ones are [Repl.it](https://repl.it/),\n  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/),\n  [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or\n  [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).\n- **Online Learning Environments**: There are also many online programming\n  environments online designed for beginners that simplify the developer\n  experience and allow you to focus on learning the basics without getting\n  distracted by advanced features. Many of these come with built-in graphics\n  libraries or support for game development. These include\n  [code.org](https://code.org/) (develop and play games with JS),\n  [editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/) (create interactive artwork),\n  [PencilCode](https://pencilcode.net/edit/myprogram) (write your code as blocks\n  or text).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Beyond the Browser\n\nYou can also use JavaScript outside of the browser to create web servers,\ndevelop mobile apps, program a\n[Raspberry Pi](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp), program\nIOT (Internet of Things) Devices, and much more.\n\n[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is the most popular non-browser runtime for\nJavaScript. [Deno](https://deno.land/) is a newer runtime developed as a more\nsecure and developer-friendly alternative to Node.js.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [javascript.info/intro](https://javascript.info/intro)\n- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB7y0yxZjro)\n- [Andrew Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) \\(first 5 minutes\\)\n- [Code School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nItSSTwBvSU)\n- [MDN: First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)\n- [Danielle Thé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78)\n\n---\n\n## Programs: Source Code\n\nJavaScript is the language used to write the Source Code in this diagram:\n\n[![program diagram](../../assets/a-program.png)](https://excalidraw.com/#json=_cj6JYwuO38PPGKxXN_cQ,3910Z7e2jGLZu4vjueG-Bg)\n"},{"name":"study.json","type":"file","ext":".json","base":"study","dir":"1-what-is-programming","path":"/1-what-is-programming/study.json","lang":".json","content":"{\n  \"study\": {\n    \"loopGuard\": false\n  }\n}\n"}]},{"name":"2-predictive-stepping","type":"directory","path":"/2-predictive-stepping","children":[null,{"name":"README.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"README","dir":"2-predictive-stepping","path":"/2-predictive-stepping/README.md","lang":".md","content":"# Predictive Stepping\n\n_Predictive Stepping_ is a study method where you quiz yourself on each step of a program's execution, checking your predictions with using a debugger.

Investigate if you were wrong: Is this a bug in the program, or is it something you did not understand?\n\nThat's it, happy studies!\n"},{"name":"predicting-execution","type":"directory","path":"/2-predictive-stepping/predicting-execution","children":[null,{"name":"1-browser-debugger.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"1-browser-debugger","dir":"2-predictive-stepping/predicting-execution","path":"/2-predictive-stepping/predicting-execution/1-browser-debugger.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\n/* A suggested workflow for studying code in your DevTools' debugger\n\n  Getting Ready\n  1 - open your code with study-lenses\n    open this repo in your terminal and enter `$ study`\n    a new tab should open in your browser\n    select the file you want to study and get going!\n  2 - open and configure your DevTools (this will take some searching and practice)\n    - move it to the right or left of your browser\n    - open the \"sources\" tab\n    - hide the navigator (the menu on the left with this page's scripts)\n    - in the right panel, collapse the section called \"threads\" (if it's there)\n    - open the console in the drawer (that part down at the bottom)\n\n  Studying\n  1 - click the \"debug\" button\n  2 - find the highlighted line of code in the debugger (this is the first line that will be executed)\n  3 - for each step in your script's execution:\n    A - before pressing the \"Step\" button (->) button ask yourself (out loud if possible)\n        - \"which line will be executed next?\"\n        - \"will this next line ...\n            ... read from memory?\"\n            ... write to memory?\"  (careful, it's possible to do both!)\n            ... log to the console?\"\n            ... create a new block scope?\"\n            ... decide the flow of my program?\" (ie. if, while, for)\n        - \"what will the memory panel on the right look like after this step is finished?\"\n        - Pro Tip: write and draw your predictions on a piece of paper!

The HYF way of learning is not\nglamorous. You will need to learn how to study JS, and very importantly\n\n- you will need to adjust your learning expectations\n\nStudying JavaScript will be 100% different from learning HTML and CSS. HTML &\nCSS are all about learning and applying rules. if you apply the rules correctly,\nyour web page looks right. You don't need to think about what happens between\nyour code and the final web page\n\n- Studying JavaScript is 100% about what happens behind the scenes\n\nProgramming is all about inner processes. You should focus 100% on what happens\nbetween starting your script and the final result. Making your code work, or\nsolving a challenge is second. Learning how the JavaScript engine executes your\ncode step-by-step is first. You should focus on ...\n\n---\n\n## Program Memory\n\n_Program Memory_ is a term that refers to the values stored in memory at EACH\nSPECIFIC moment of execution. These values can change often, sometimes at every\nstep of your program! Learning to program requires you to understand:\n\n- how does the JS engine represent memory?\n- how does the JS engine interpret your code line-by-line?\n- how does each instruction interact with program memory?\n\nYour first goal is learning to see what is happening inside your program at each\nstep:\n\n- **DevTools Debugger**: The best way to peek inside program memory. It will\n  take some practice to use effectively and is worth every second. You can see\n  every value in memory, at every step of your program's execution. Debuggers\n  are designed to help you understand how memory is structured in

You do not need to understand everything about truthiness in\nthis module, but understanding the basic idea will make logical operators and\ncontrol flow more clear.\n\nTo convert a value to type `\"boolean\"` you just need to pass it to the `Boolean`\nfunction that comes built into JS. Maybe the easiest way to begin learning\ntruthiness is to learn the _falsy_ values, there are not very many values that\nconvert to `false`. All the rest become `true`!\n\nThese are the falsy values you will come across in this module:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\n// the boolean value `false`\nconsole.log(Boolean(false)); // false\n\n// the empty string, no matter what type of quotes you use\nconsole.log(Boolean('')); // false\n\n// null\nconsole.log(Boolean(null)); // false\n\n// undefined\nconsole.log(Boolean(undefined)); // false\n\n// the number `0`\nconsole.log(Boolean(0)); // false\nconsole.log(Boolean(0.0)); // false\n// and the number NaN, but you'll learn more about this in the next module\nconsole.log(Boolean(NaN)); // false\n```\n\n> You will study _truthiness_ and _type casting_ in depth with the Debugging\n> module.\n"}]},{"name":"05-strings","type":"directory","path":"/2.1-primitives-and-operators/05-strings","children":[{"name":"README.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"README","dir":"2.1-primitives-and-operators/05-strings","path":"/2.1-primitives-and-operators/05-strings/README.md","lang":".md","content":"# Strings\n\nA primitive type used for saving and working with text.

Here\nare three errors you will make quite a bit when you start your own\n[explorations](../explorations), even a spelling mistake can cause these errors!\n\nYou may get different error messages depending on which browser you are using,\nbut they mean the same thing. In Debugging we will go much deeper into\ninterpreting and correcting program errors.\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 not declaring a variable</summary>\n<br>\n\nUsing a variable that has not been declared will throw an error (when you're in\nstrict mode, but that's a story for another day. All the exercises in this repo\nare run in strict mode).\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- not declaring 1 --');\n\n// let animal; // uncomment this line to fix the error\nanimal = 'horse'; // ReferenceError\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- not declaring 2 --');\n\n// a common mistake is spelling your variables incorrectly\nlet spellingMistake = 'oops!';\nconsole.log(spelingMistake); // ReferenceError\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 using a variable before it is declared</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- using before declaration --');\n\n// read the variable - will throw an error!\nconsole.log(favoriteColor); // ReferenceError\n\n// declare and initialize the variable\nlet favoriteColor = 'red';\n\n// read the variable\nconsole.log(favoriteColor);\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 declaring a variable twice</summary>\n<br>\n\nDeclaring a variable tells JavaScript to prepare a place in memory with that\nname. Trying to create two spaces in memory with the same name will cause an\nerror.\n\n- Chrome & Chromium-based browsers:\n  `SyntaxError: Identifier '_' has already been declared`\n- Firefox: `SyntaxError: redeclaration of let _`\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n// ! this log never happens !\n//  syntax errors happen before the program runs\n//  so no single line of code will happen\n//  you will learn more about program life cycle in Debugging\nconsole.log('-- declaring twice --');\n\nlet vegetable = 'carrot';\nlet vegetable = 'potato'; // SyntaxError\n// vegetable = 'potato'; // no error\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Variable Names\n\nIn JavaScript there are a few rules about naming variables. There aren't too\nmany rules and the rules aren't very complicated, you just need to learn them:\n\n- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/variables#variable-naming)\n- [nexTRIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5WlRR-lEDE)\n- [launchcode](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/data-and-variables/reading/more-on-variables/index.html#naming-variables)\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 variable names <strong>can</strong> use numbers, letters, $, or _</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- valid variable names --');\n// all of these variable names are ok\n\nlet $ = 1;\nlet _ = 2;\nlet a = 3;\nlet A = 4;\nlet b1_$ = 5;\nlet HackYourFuture2021_$ = 6;\nlet b_e_l_g_i_u_m = 7;\n// ...\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 variable names <strong>are</strong> case-sensitive</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- variable names are case-sensitive --');\n\n// notice, there is no error.\n//  JS does not consider this as declaring the same variable twice\nlet javascript = 'a programming language';\nlet JavaScript = 'upper case!';\n\nconsole.log(javascript); // 'a programming language'\nconsole.log(JavaScript); // 'upper case!'\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 variable names can <strong>not</strong> start with a number</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- variable names cannot start with a number --')\n\nlet a1 = 'this works';\n\nlet 1a = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 variable names can not use any other characters</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet a*a = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet a-b-c = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet @hyf = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n// spaces count as other characters\nlet hack your future = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 variable names can not be <strong>reserved words</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nIn JavaScript there are some words that you cannot use as variable names. These\nare called _Reserved Words_. Some of them are words which carry special meaning\nin JS like `let` or `null`. Other reserved words don't have any special meaning\nyet, but may in the future.\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet var = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet null = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet function = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet public = 'will throw an error';\n```\n\nall the reserved works, in a list:\n\n- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords)\n- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp)\n\n</details>\n\n### Good Variable Names\n\nJust because a variable name doesn't throw an error doesn't mean it's a good\nname.\n\nA good variable name is easy to read and helps you understand what the program\ndoes. You will learn more about how to choose good variable names in Debugging.\nFor now take a look at these two programs with the same logic. see how good\nnames help, and bad names can be confusing:\n\n<details>\n<summary>🐣 confusing variable names</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet thisThing = 'hello';\nlet thatThing = '';\n\nfor (let oneThing of thisThing) {\n  thatThing = oneThing + thatThing;\n}\n\nconsole.log(thatThing); // 'olleh'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>🐣 helpful variable names</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet forwards = 'hello';\nlet backwards = '';\n\nfor (let nextLetter of forwards) {\n  backwards = nextLetter + backwards;\n}\n\nconsole.log(backwards); // 'olleh'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Built-in Variables\n\nSome variables already come with JavaScript, you do not need to declare them to\nuse them. Think of `console` - you didn't write that variable but you use it all\nthe time.\n\nThese a not the same as reserved words, you can use declare or reassign them!\nDeclaring built-in variables will almost always cause problems in your programs\nbecause you _over-write_ the value that was stored before. There are some\nadvanced use-cases when this is helpful, but you won't learn about those at HYF.\n\nHere are some examples of using built-in variable names in your programs. These\nare just examples, not suggestions ;)\n\n<details>\n<summary>🐥 assigning to a built-in variable</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n// this log will work because console has not been reassigned\nconsole.log('-- assigning to console --');\n\nconsole = 'hello';\n\n// see? it's a string!\nalert(console);\n\n// this log will not work, console now stores a string\nconsole.log('will throw an error');\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🐥 declaring a built-in name</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- declaring a variable named alert 1 --');\n\n// this will not work!\n//  JS treats this like using a variable before it's declaration\nalert('huh?'); // ReferenceError - use before declare\n\nlet alert = 'hello';\n\nconsole.log(alert);\n```\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- declaring a variable named alert 2 --');\n\nlet alert = 'hello';\n\nconsole.log(alert);\n\nalert('will throw an error'); // TypeError - not a function\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [launchcode](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/data-and-variables/variables.html)\n- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/variables)\n- [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/variables-constants)\n- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)\n- [HYF](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study/#/javascript/variables)\n"},{"name":"study.json","type":"file","ext":".json","base":"study","dir":"2.2-variables/07-variables","path":"/2.2-variables/07-variables/study.json","lang":".json","content":"{\n  \"study\": {\n    \"trace\": {\n      \"functions\": false,\n      \"controlFlow\": false,\n      \"operators\": false\n    },\n    \"flowchart\": false,\n    \"openIn\": \"jsTutor\",\n    \"ask\": {\n      \"operators\": false,\n      \"controlFlow\": false,\n      \"levels\": [1, 2, 3]\n    },\n    \"loopGuard\": false\n  },\n  \"highlight\": {\n    \"trace\": {\n      \"functions\": false,\n      \"controlFlow\": false,\n      \"operators\": false,\n      \"console\": false\n    },\n    \"openIn\": \"jsTutor\",\n    \"flowchart\": false,\n    \"ask\": {\n      \"operators\": false,\n      \"controlFlow\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n"}]},{"name":"1-variables","type":"directory","path":"/2.2-variables/1-variables","children":[{"name":"1-declaring.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"1-declaring","dir":"2.2-variables/1-variables","path":"/2.2-variables/1-variables/1-declaring.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\n/* Declaring a Variable\n\n  declaring a variable creates a new \"box\" in program memory,\n    the box will begin empty.\n\n  variable declarations have two main parts:\n\n  - keyword: let, const or var.

After\nyou've learned how to trace, code can still be tricky to understand but at least\nthere is no more mystery.\n\n---\n\n## Ways to Trace\n\nThere are many techniques for tracing a program, each one has some pros and\ncons. What matters most at this point is that you try them all find the one that\nhelps you most:\n\n- **The `?variables` lens**: Helpful to find your way around the code before\n  moving on to the dynamic tracing techniques. This lens will help you find all\n  the variables and how they are used in the code.\n- **JS Tutor**: This website visualizes how program memory works. You can step\n  forwards and backwards through the program one statement at a time, seeing how\n  each instruction interacts with memory. Studying in this site has two separate\n  steps, just like with a real JS program:\n  1. Write code in the editor\n  2. Run the code and step tep through it in the visualization page\n- **The \"trace\" button**: When you click this button it will run your code and\n  log every step of execution to the console. Compared to JS Tutor the \"trace\"\n  button will step through your program in more detail (logging every operator),\n  but will not have a nice visualization of memory.\n- **Trace Tables (\"tables\" button)**: This is a way to manually trace a program,\n  writing down each time a variable is used so you can understand the program's\n  dynamic behavior. You can check your trace tables by comparing them to the\n  console output from the \"trace\" button.\n- **Learn With Trace**: Like JS Tutor, but with different visualizations.\n- **JS Tutor Live**: This is like JS Tutor, but with only one page. You edit the\n  code and step through it on the same page. As you change the code the\n  visualization will update in real time. This is helpful for quicker studying\n  but is not how a real JS program works.\n- **The `?highlight` lens**: This allows you to draw on the code, tracing the\n  program's execution with different colors. This technique works very well for\n  group study. (programs in this folder will open with `?highlight` by default)\n- **🐔 The Debugger**: Built into your browser is a great tool for stepping\n  through your programs and understanding every detail of execution. If this is\n  too much information at first then you can leave it for now, you'll cover this\n  in depth with the Debugging module.\n\nSo that's a lot of info, but how can you know when you've understood a program\nand are ready to study the next? It's quite simple actually: can you correctly\nfill out a trace table without looking at the console output?\n\nTrace tables are such a great tool for study and self-assessment that there's a\nwhole section about them ...\n\n---\n\n## Trace Tables\n\nTrace tables have been around as long as computer programming (probably). The\nchallenge with a trace table is to run the code in your head, keeping track of\nall the variables in your program by hand. This is also called a _dry run_ or a\n_desk check_.\n\nYou can write trace tables on paper with a pencil (always a good way to go), or\nyou can use the trace tables built into Study Lenses. There are three different\ntypes of trace table available in Study Lenses:\n\n1. **steps**: The _steps_ table asks you to be the computer and to go step by\n   step through the program, recording each time a variable is declared, read,\n   or assigned. When you use the steps table you can check your work by pressing\n   `trace` button and comparing your table to the console output.\n2. **values**: The _values_ table is the traditional type of trace table. With\n   the _values_ table you only keep track of each time a variable is assigned a\n   new value. You can also check your _values_ table by using the `trace` button\n   and only checking against the _assign_ logs\n3. **Operators**: This table is for studying operator precedence, you'll learn\n   more about this in Debugging.\n\nYou may find that the **steps** table is more helpful in the beginning when you\nare first learning. It forces you to pay close attention to each step of program\nexecution.\n\nLater on you may prefer the **values** table because it allows you to look at\nthe bigger picture and see more clearly the _strategy_ (or _algorithm_) of a\nprogram.\n"},{"name":"study.json","type":"file","ext":".json","base":"study","dir":"2.2-variables/2-tracing-variables","path":"/2.2-variables/2-tracing-variables/study.json","lang":".json","content":"{\n  \"--defaults\": {\n    \".js\": \"highlight\"\n  }\n}\n"}]},{"name":"3-variable-names","type":"directory","path":"/2.2-variables/3-variable-names","children":[{"name":"1.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"1","dir":"2.2-variables/3-variable-names","path":"/2.2-variables/3-variable-names/1.md","lang":".md","content":"# Variable Names: 1\n\nAll of these programs log the same final value.

Can you find anything different between the\ncomments in each program?\n\n---\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- program 1 --- ');\n\n// declare variable 1: let\n// initialize variable 1: \"hello\"\nlet greeting = 'hello';\n\n// declare variable 2: let\n// initialize variable 2: \"!\"\nlet excitement = '!';\n\n// read from variable 1: \"hello\"\n// read from variable 2: \"!\"\n// assign to variable 1: \"hello!\"\ngreeting = greeting + excitement;\n\n// read from variable 1: \"hello!\"\nconsole.log(greeting);\n```\n\n---\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- program 2 --- ');\n\n// declare variable 1: let\n// initialize variable 1: \"hello\"\nlet x = 'hello';\n\n// declare variable 2: let\n// initialize variable 2: \"!\"\nlet y = '!';\n\n// read from variable 1: \"hello\"\n// read from variable 2: \"!\"\n// assign to variable 1: \"hello!\"\nx = x + y;\n\n// read from variable 1: \"hello!\"\nconsole.log(x);\n```\n"}]},{"name":"tracing-variables","type":"directory","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables","children":[{"name":"README.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"README","dir":"2.2-variables/tracing-variables","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables/README.md","lang":".md","content":"# Tracing Variables\n\nWith HTML & CSS it's enough to learn what goes in and what comes out, you don't\nneed to know what happens in between:\n\n- HTML/CSS --> ... ? ... --> a website\n\nWith JavaScript it's the opposite. The steps in the middle are what you should\n_focus on learning_:\n\n- input data --> **a lot of important steps** --> output data\n\nPractice stepping through code the same way a computer does so you can\nunderstand all of these important steps. You know you are doing well when you\ncan predict what the [trace] button will log to the console. The [table] button\ncan help you write your predictions before checking your guesses in the console.\n\n## Trace Tables\n\nTrace tables have been around as long as computer programming (probably). The\npurpose of a trace table is to help you run the code in your head, keeping track\nof all the variables in your program by hand. This is also called a _dry run_ or\na _desk check_.\n\nThe [table] button makes a trace table you can use to be the computer and to go\nstep by step through the program, recording each time a variable is declared,\nread, or assigned. When you use the steps table you can check your work by\npressing `trace` button and comparing your table to the console output.\n\nDon't worry if this is challenging, you'll have lots of opportunity to practice\ntracing in this module.\n"},{"name":"examples","type":"directory","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples","children":[{"name":"0-comments.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"0-comments","dir":"2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples/0-comments.js","lang":".js","content":"/* Comments\n\n  comments are used to leave notes for other developers\n    the computer will ignore them\n\n  there are two kinds of comments in JS\n  - block comments (this is a block comment)\n  - inline comments\n\n*/\n\n// this is an inline comment\n"},{"name":"1-strings.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"1-strings","dir":"2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples/1-strings.js","lang":".js","content":"/* Strings\n\n  strings are a data type used to work with text in programs\n\n  in JS, a string is anything wrapped in quotation marks\n\n*/\n\n// an empty string\n'';\n\n// a string with the text \"a string!\"\n'a string!';\n\n// a string with quotes in it\n'cows say \"moo\"';\n"},{"name":"2-console-log.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"2-console-log","dir":"2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples","path":"/2.2-variables/tracing-variables/examples/2-console-log.js","lang":".js","content":"/* Console Logging\n\n  the console is where info is displayed for developers\n\n  `console.log` is the simplest way to display something\n\n  PS.

User Interactions\n\nLogging is for developers, Interactions are for Users. JavaScript in the browser\nhas 3 ways to do basic user interactions. They don't create the best user\nexperience but they are practical for learning to program.\n\nLearning to use these 3 functions will help you to understand primitive types\nand values. Each interaction is a _function_ (you'll learn more about functions\nin Debugging). Functions _return_ a value, meaning that you can use them to\nassign a value to a variable. But each interaction returns a _different_ type.\n\nAdding interactions into your programs will make them more interesting to study.\nYou can't know exactly what values a user will input, so your programs have to\ndeal with some uncertainty!\n\nTrace this example and see each type of interaction in action:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- user interactions --');\n\nlet alertValue = alert('this is an alert');\nconsole.log(alertValue); // undefined\n\nlet confirmValue = confirm('this is a confirm');\nconsole.log(confirmValue); // true or false\n\nlet promptValue = prompt('this is a prompt');\nconsole.log(promptValue); // a string or null\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 alert</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- alert --');\n// alert: displays a message to the user\n//  the user can only read the message, they can't input anything to your program\nlet alerted = alert('pancakes');\n\n// alert will always return undefined, no matter what\nconsole.log(alerted); // undefined\nconsole.log(typeof alerted); // 'undefined'\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 confirm</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- confirm --');\n// confirm: display a message and ask the user to say \"yes\" or \"no\"\n\n// run this example a few times with your console open. what happens if you:\n//  click \"ok\"?\n//  click \"cancel\"?\n//  press the \"enter\" key on your keyboard?\n//  pres the \"esc\" key on your keyboard?\nlet confirmed = confirm('want some pancakes?');\n\n// confirm will always return a boolean value:\n//  true if the user clicks ok\n//  false if the user clicks cancel\nconsole.log(confirmed); // true or false\nconsole.log(typeof confirmed); // 'boolean'\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 prompt</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- prompt --');\n\n// prompt: display a message and allow the user to input some text\n\n// run this example a few times in the console. what happens if you:\n//  type something -> click \"cancel\" or press the \"esc\" key\n//  type something -> click \"ok\" or press the \"enter\" key\n//  do not type anything -> click \"cancel\" or press the \"esc\" key\n//  do not type anything -> click \"ok\" or press the \"enter\" key\nlet prompted = prompt('what is your favorite kind of pancake');\n\n// prompt will either return a string or null\n//  null: if the user clicks \"cancel\" or presses the \"esc\" key\n//  string: if the user clicks \"ok\" or uses the \"enter\" key\n//    it doesn't matter if the user types anything or not!\n//    if they type nothing, prompt returns an empty string\nconsole.log(prompted); // the user's text or null\nconsole.log(typeof prompted); // 'string' or 'object'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Tracing User Interactions\n\nTracing code with user interactions is more challenging than tracing code with\nno interactions. In programs with user interactions it's impossible to know what\nvalues will be in your program until you run it!\n\nThis means you must think about all the different things a user could do. To\nfully understand an interactive program you will need to trace it many times,\neach time with different imagined values from the user.\n\n---\n\n## A Small Program\n\nHere's a small program that uses `prompt`, `alert` and `confirm`. You'll learn\nhow it all works in the coming chapters.\n\n<details>\n<summary>check it out</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- user interactions --');\n\nlet input = null;\nwhile (input === null) {\n  input = prompt('enter something');\n}\n\nlet didConfirm = confirm('is this correct?\\n\\n \"' + input + '\"');\nif (didConfirm) {\n  alert('yes!');\n} else {\n  alert('no :(');\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n"}]},{"name":"null.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"null","dir":"2.4-prompt-alert-confirm","path":"/2.4-prompt-alert-confirm/null.md","lang":".md","content":"# Null\n\nAnother primitive type used to represent nothing.\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- null --');\n\n// that's it, plain and simple\nconsole.log(null);\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 typeof</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- typeof null --');\n\n// this is not intuitive, you just need to memorize it\nconsole.log(null); // null\nconsole.log(typeof null); // 'object'\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 strict equality</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- null: strict equality --');\n\n// null is only strictly equal to null\nconsole.log(null === null); // true\n\n// any other comparison is false\nconsole.log(null === 'null'); // false\nconsole.log(null === 0); // false\nconsole.log(null === undefined); // false\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚  strict inequality</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- null: strict inequality --');\n// this will always be the opposite of strict equality\n\nconsole.log(null !== null); // false\n\n// any other strict inequality with null will be true\nconsole.log(null !== 'null'); // true\nconsole.log(null !== 0); // true\nconsole.log(null !== undefined); // true\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## `null` vs. `undefined`\n\n> The ECMAScript language specification describes them as follows:\n>\n> - `undefined` is “used when a variable has not been assigned a value”\n> - `null` “represents the intentional absence of any object value”\n>\n> [2ality](https://2ality.com/2021/01/undefined-null-revisited.html)\n\nThe practical difference between `null` and `undefined` is that `null` will not\nappear in your program by accident. `undefined` can appear in your program if\nyou forgot to assign a value, but `null` always need to be assigned.\n\nIf a variable stores `null` it was put there on purpose.\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- variables with null --');\n\n// you need to assign null to a variable\n//  a variable cannot store null by accident\nlet variable;\nconsole.log(variable); // undefined\nconsole.log(typeof variable); // 'undefined'\n\nvariable = null;\nconsole.log(variable); // null\nconsole.log(typeof variable); // 'object'\n\n// you can also initialize a variable to null\nlet breakfast = null;\nconsole.log(breakfast);\nconsole.log(typeof breakfast);\n```\n"}]},{"name":"2.5-errors","type":"directory","path":"/2.5-errors","children":[null,{"name":"z-errors-and-bugs","type":"directory","path":"/2.5-errors/z-errors-and-bugs","children":[{"name":"1-errors","type":"directory","path":"/2.5-errors/z-errors-and-bugs/1-errors","children":[{"name":"README.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"README","dir":"2.5-errors/z-errors-and-bugs/1-errors","path":"/2.5-errors/z-errors-and-bugs/1-errors/README.md","lang":".md","content":"# Errors\n\nWhen something is wrong in your code that causes the program to stop.\n\n---\n\n## Program Life-Cycle\n\nWhen you run a program, there are actually two phases that happen behind the\nscenes:\n\n1. **Creation Phase**: The JS interpreter will \"read\" (parse) your code and\n   prepare the environment to execute your program.\n\n2. **Execution Phase**: Actually following your instructions, executing your\n   program one step at a time.\n\n---\n\n## Describing Errors\n\nTo search or ask for help when you have an error, you need to know how to\ndescribe the error:\n\n- **Environment**: Node + version? Browser? Which browser?\n\n- **Name**: The error's name logged in the console.\n\n- **Message**: The error's message logged in the console.\n\n- **Location**: The line & column where your error occurred.\n\n- **Life-Cycle**: Did it occur during creation or execution?\n\n---\n\n## Searching Errors Online\n\nWhen searching for help online, you want to use the information that is not\nspecific to _your_ program. This includes:\n\n- **Environment**: Node + version? Browser? Which browser?\n\n- **Name**: The error's name logged in the console.\n\n- **Message**: The error's message logged in the console.\n\n---\n\n## Finding Error Locations\n\nTo find where an error occurred in your debugger, click on the link to the right\nof the error message in your console:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- in execution phase ---');\n\nlet x = 1;\n\nlet x = 2;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pausing on Errors\n\nYou can also configure your devtools to pause on errors by clicking the stop\nsign in the upper right corner of your debugger. This will show you which values\nwere in memory when the error occurred:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- in execution phase ---');\n\nlet input = 6;\n\nfor (let i of input) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Mistakes vs. Errors\n\nWhen fixing errors it's important to tell the difference between the _error_ in\nyour program and the _mistake_ in your code. Often the error will be on a\ndifferent line than your mistake:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- in execution phase ---');\n\n// mistake: assigning null to input\nlet input = null;\n\n// error: accessing .length of null\nif (input.length < 5) {\n  console.log('too short');\n} else {\n  console.log('perfect');\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Fixing Errors\n\nFixing errors is not as simple as making the code run! Sometimes there will be\nmore than one way to fix an error, choosing the best option will take practice\nand experience:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('--- in execution phase ---');\n\n/*\n  should the second variable be named `y`?\n  or should there only be one variable: `x = 2`?\n*/\n\nlet x = 1;\n\nlet x = 2;\n```\n\n---\n\n## The Exercises\n\nThere is bunch of code with errors. Practice finding the errors in the debugger,\ndescribing the errors, and fixing them. You will use this comment to organize\nyour notes:\n\n```js\n/*\n  environment:\n\n  name:\n  message:\n\n  location:\n\n  life cycle:\n\n  the mistake:\n\n  the

In Welcome to JS most of the exercises\nask you to study programs that work so you shouldn't face tooo many errors. When\nyou do get an error, don't let this get you down. It's easier to write code that\n_has_ errors than to write code that _doesn't_!\n\nUnderstanding and fixing errors in your code will take lots of practice, in the\nnext module you will study errors in depth. For now all you need to know about\nerrors is:\n\n- the error _name_ and _message_ so you can search about it online. You don't\n  need to understand everything you read about the error, but you should be able\n  to find links about it.\n- finding the line where the error occurred by reading the error log and\n  clicking on the line number .\n- `ctr-z`, so you can undo your error and try again.\n\nAs you complete each exercise you should keep track of all the errors you\nencountered. Try thinking of errors as the computer's best attempt at helping\nyou fix your mistakes. Take notes on which errors you make the most often and\nwhat you figure out to avoid them.\n\n## Run Early and Often\n\nAnother strategy for dealing with errors is to run your code early and often:\nafter every single tiny change try running the program. This helps you figure\nout what went wrong because the error must be related to the tiny change you\njust made.\n\n## ReferenceError: \\_ is not defined\n\nThere is one error you do not need to keep track of in your notes -\n`ReferenceError: _ is not defined`. You will get this error all the time, and\nit's not because of the code you write. we use \\_ to show you where something is\nmissing in the program, but JavaScript reads \\_ as a variable that has not been\ndeclared.\n\nInstead of dreading this error, you can thank it for telling you where the next\nblank is!\n\n---\n\n- Launchcode:\n  [categories](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/errors-and-debugging/categories-of-errors.html),\n  [diagnosing](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/errors-and-debugging/diagnosing-error-messages.html)\n"}]},{"name":"z-fixing-errors","type":"directory","path":"/2.5-errors/z-fixing-errors","children":[null,{"name":"README.md","type":"file","ext":".md","base":"README","dir":"2.5-errors/z-fixing-errors","path":"/2.5-errors/z-fixing-errors/README.md","lang":".md","content":"# Fixing Errors\n\nProgram life cycle is the air JavaScript breaths, you may not notice it but it's\nalways there and it's pretty darned important. Taking the time to become\nfamiliar with the life-cycle of JS program will make it easier to debug your\ncode and to learn the tricker topics everyone's talking about; scope, errors,\nhoisting, strict mode, you name it.\n\nLearning to recognize the difference between your source code (simply a text\nfile) and the dynamic runtime of your program (values changing in memory) is a\ncritical skill. Before it 'clicks', it will be a mystery. After it 'clicks' it\nwill be almost simple. To understand a running program you need to be aware of\nthe life-cycle of a JS program:\n\n0. **Source Code**: the text file sitting in your computer's folder system. it\n   doesn't do anything, it's just like any other text file\n1. **Creation Phase**: before actually running your program, the javascript\n   parser will \"read\" your code and get everything ready to run your program\n   (without running the program!)\n2. **Execution Phase**: running your program! carrying out your instructions one\n   at a time\n\n---\n\n## 4 Principles\n\n1. **JavaScript Syntax**\n   - You can think of this like spelling, grammar & vocabulary. If you open\n     parenthesis, you must close them or the JS parser will not understand what\n     you wrote. If you use a symbol that JS doesn't support it will throw an\n     error. If you write anything that JS does not understand or write code that\n     JS does not allow, you will get a syntax error.\n   - Learning JS syntax means building your understanding of what is and isn't\n     allowed, then recognizing & fixing mistakes you make. This is just a lot of\n     memorization and attention to detail. Fortunately most modern code editors\n     have a lot of features to help you with this.\n2. **JavaScript Semantics**\n   - Just because your code has correct syntax doesn't mean everything is ok! It\n     is still possible for you to use correct syntax in incorrect ways. The\n     rules that define correct and incorrect usage are JS semantics.\n   - You can think of it like normal language. You may be using english words\n     that are spelled correctly, but that doesn't mean your grammar is correct!\n     \"Red dog woods running\"\n3. **Creation Phase** & **Execution Phase**\n   - _Creation phase_ is what happens before the program runs. JS will interpret\n     your code and prepare the program memory. Some types of error occur during\n     creation phase.\n   - _Execution Phase_ is everything that happens after the creation phase. This\n     is when JS executes your program one instruction at a time. Different\n     errors can occur in execution phase than in creation phase.\n4. **Errors**\n   - **creation phase errors**: Bad \"spelling\" or bad \"grammar\". Your program\n     can either not be understood by the JS parser, or made a mistake that the\n     parser was able to find without running your code. Your program will not\n     continue to the execution phase.\n   - **execution phase errors**: Commonly called \"runtime errors\". You made no\n     syntax errors and no semantic errors the parser could catch, so your\n     program entered execution phase. But somewhere in your program you\n     instructed JavaScript to do something that is not possible, maybe trying to\n     use a variable that wasn't declared.\n\n### All together\n\n| _Error Classifications_ |                                                                                               syntax error                                                                                                |                                                                                                        semantic error                                                                                                        |\n| :---------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|   **creation phase**    |                                    Bad spelling, the parser can't understand (or \"parse\") what you've written. Your program will not continue to the execution phase.                                     |                  The parser was able to parse your code, but you tried doing something the parser will not allow. An error is thrown before entering execution phase. (ie. reassigning a constant variable)                  |\n|   **execution phase**   | These are less common, generally by the time your program is running there are no syntax errors. But in some cases it is possible to have run-time syntax errors in JS, worry about that when it happens. | \"runtime errors\". You made no syntax errors, and no semantic errors the parser can catch. Instead you wrote a command JS doesn't allow and won't notice untill it tries to execute that line. (these are the hardest to fix) |\n\n---\n\n## The Exercises\n\nIn this chapter you will learn some simple steps you can take to find and\nunderstand the errors in your code. You'll learn to fill in all the blanks in\nthis comment:\n\n```js\n/*\n  environment:\n\n  name:\n  message:\nl\n  callstack:\n\n  life cycle:\n\n  the mistake:\n\n  the fix(es):\n*/\n```\n\nOnce you've gotten used to finding this information in your DevTools, you're\nready to fix errors in all your projects!\n\n---\n\n## Logic Errors\n\nLogic mistakes (or \"bugs\") are when your code runs without an error, but does\nnot do what you wanted it to. This is a different topic from Errors (when your\ncode breaks). Bugs and errors are often taught together, but are actually\ndifferent. Take a look at this funny video\n[comparing syntax & logic errors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV0tQisuxPo)\nto understand the difference by analogy. You can think of it like normal\nlanguage, a sentence can have good grammar but still make no sense: \"Dogs talk\nalmost as red as a bus.\"\n\nWhile fixing errors requires \"only\" a solid understanding of the JS Syntax and\nSemantics, plus some experience with the debugger. Fixing logic mistakes also\nrequires an understanding of debugging strategies, testing and strategic\nthinking. These exercises only cover Errors.\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Describing Errors (class recording)](https://vimeo.com/530238051)\n- [creation phase & execution

creation\n    if your code opens in the debugger: execution\n  2. open your code in jsTutor\n    did your code make it to the page where you can step through?\n    if it did not, you had a creation phase error\n  3. open your code in jsTutorLive\n    does the error line have an [x] AND is highlighted red? execution!\n    is there only an [x] but no highlighting? creation!\n  4. look at the first line of your callstack, does it look like ...\n    <anonymous>:x:y   -> execution\n    <anonymous>       -> creation\n  5. in firefox: does the `debugger eval code:x:y` link work?\n    if it does not,

This\nmeans that you can no longer just read a program from top to bottom to\nunderstand how it works, different values in a program can mean that different\nlines will execute!\n\nCreating trace tables, and using the `trace` or `openIn` buttons will help you\nunderstand how programs with conditionals behave.\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 2 paths: if else</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- 2 paths: if else --');\n\nlet input = prompt('enter something');\n\nlet path = '';\nif (input === null) {\n  path = 'a';\n} else {\n  path = 'b';\n}\n\nalert(path);\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 3 paths: if else if else</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- 3 paths: if else if else --');\n\nlet input = prompt('enter something');\n\nlet path = '';\nif (input === null) {\n  path = 'a';\n} else if (input === '') {\n  path = 'b';\n} else {\n  path = 'c';\n}\n\nalert(path);\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 4 paths: nested</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- 4 paths: nested --');\n\nlet input = prompt('enter \"something\"');\n\nlet path = '';\nif (input !== null) {\n  path = 'a';\n  if (input === '') {\n    path = path + '1';\n  } else if (input === 'something') {\n    path = path + '2';\n  } else {\n    path = path + '3';\n  }\n} else {\n  path = 'b';\n}\n\nalert(path);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Nested Conditionals\n\nPrograms with more execution paths are more complex to understand, but can also\nhave a more interesting user experience. One way to write more interesting\nprograms is to use _nested conditionals_ (conditionals inside of conditionals)\n\n<details>\n<summary>🐣 memory game</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- memory game --');\n\nlet thingToRemember = prompt(\n  'enter some text, then remember it.\\n\\n' +\n    'if you remember it correctly you win',\n);\n\nif (thingToRemember !== null) {\n  let displayTheText = confirm(\n    'would you like to see your text one more time?',\n  );\n  if (displayTheText) {\n    alert(thingToRemember);\n  }\n  let guess = prompt('now try to remember what it was:');\n  if (guess !== null) {\n    if (guess === thingToRemember) {\n      alert('you win!');\n    } else {\n      alert('try again.');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nalert('good bye');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Trace Exercises\n\nThere will be two kinds of tracing exercises from now on, **interactive** and\n**not interactive**. Each will help you explore the different _execution paths_\nof a program.\n\nThe **interactive** trace exercises will use `prompt`, `alert` and `confirm` to\nintroduce different values into your program.\n\nThe **not interactive** exercises will have a few variable declarations at the\ntop of the file with different initial values. You can comment and uncomment the\nvariables to see how the program behaves with different values:\n\n<details>\n<summary>🥚 example not-interactive exercise</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet value = -1;\n// let value = -0.5;\n// let value = 0;\n// let value = 0.5;\n// let value = 1;\n\nlet message;\nif (value < 0) {\n  message = 'too small';\n} else if (value === 0) {\n  message = 'perfect';\n} else if (value > 0) {\n  message = 'too big';\n} else {\n  message = 'this path is unreachable!';\n}\n\nconsole.log(message);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [RichardCodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAOSKGV9bqg)\n- [Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsG4Xd6LlsM)\n- [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/if-else)\n- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/ifelse)\n- [launchcode](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/booleans-and-conditionals/conditionals.html)\n- MDN:\n  [the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else),\n  [intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)\n"}]},{"name":"3.2-while-loop","type":"directory","path":"/3.2-while-loop","children":[null,{"name":"1-isolate","type":"directory","path":"/3.2-while-loop/1-isolate","children":[{"name":"repeat-string.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"repeat-string","dir":"3.2-while-loop/1-isolate","path":"/3.2-while-loop/1-isolate/repeat-string.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet animal = 'dog';\n// let animal = 'cat';\n// let animal = 'horse';\n// let animal = 'fish';\n// let animal = 'whale';\n// let animal = 'elephant';\n// let animal = 'snake';\n// let animal = 'dove';\n\nlet repeated = '';\nlet i = 0;\nwhile (i < animal.length) {\n  repeated = repeated + '\\n' + animal;\n  i = i + 1;\n}\n\nconsole.log(repeated);\n"},{"name":"reverse-1.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"reverse-1","dir":"3.2-while-loop/1-isolate","path":"/3.2-while-loop/1-isolate/reverse-1.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet word = 'racecar';\n// let word = 'bike';\n// let word = 'f';\n// let word = ' i o u ';\n// let word = 'done.';\n\nlet reversed = '';\n\nlet index = 0;\nwhile (word.length !== reversed.length) {\n  let nextChar = word[index];\n  reversed = nextChar + reversed;\n  index = index + 1;\n}\n\nconsole.log(word, reversed);\n"},{"name":"reverse-2.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"reverse-2","dir":"3.2-while-loop/1-isolate","path":"/3.2-while-loop/1-isolate/reverse-2.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet word = 'racecar';\n// let word = 'bike';\n// let word = 'f';\n// let word = ' i o u ';\n// let word = 'done.';\n\nlet reversed = '';\n\nlet index = word.length -

A\nboolean flag is a variable that stores a boolean that you can set to `true` or\n`false` depending on what has happened in your program.\n\nBoolean flags are useful when the logic of your for loop is more complicated:\n\n<details>\n<summary>🐣 boolean flag</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nlet input = '';\nlet prompting = true;\nwhile (prompting) {\n  input = prompt(\n    'enter something longer than 4 characters, or \"cancel\" to leave',\n  );\n  if (input === null) {\n    prompting = false;\n    input = 'you canceled';\n  } else if (input.length > 4) {\n    prompting = false;\n  }\n}\nalert(input);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Infinite Loops\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- while true --');\n\n// this is the simplest infinite loop\n//  while loops continue so long as the condition is true\n//  this condition is true and will never change!\n\nwhile (true) {\n  // the only way to end this loop is to close the browser tab\n  console.log('... forever ...');\n}\n```\n\nSometimes you will write a loop that never ends. There's many ways to do this,\nand it will happen a lot while you're studying. It's easy to accidentally write\nan infinite loop, and hard to predict when it will happen.\n\nSome infinite loops are easy to find just by reading your code, others are\ntrickier to guess. Check out the **[./infinite-loops](./infinite-loops)** folder\nto practice running and fixing infinite loops.\n\n### 🐣 Loop Guards\n\nOne way to avoid infinite loops is to use _loop guards_.\n\nA loop guard is a little extra code in your program that throws an error if a\nloop repeats too many times. This kind of loop guard isn't something you'll use\nin your professional code, but it's very helpful while you're learning.\n\n<details>\n<summary>loop guard: 10 iterations</summary>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\nconsole.log('-- loop guard: 10 iterations --');\n\nlet loopGuard = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n  loopGuard = loopGuard + 1;\n  if (loopGuard > 10) {\n    throw new RangeError('loopGuard exceeded 10 iterations');\n  }\n\n  console.log('(not) forever');\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\nWhen you use the `?study` lens there is an option that will automatically add\nloop guards to your code when you run it. This way you can write your code\nwithout the extra code, and still have the security of a loop guard when you run\nit.\n\n---\n\n## No `else`\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n// this is not allowed in JS! you will get a syntax error\n//  it looks logical and useful, but does not exist\n\nlet input = null;\nwhile (input === null) {\n  input = prompt('enter something');\n} else { // SyntaxError\n  alert('canceling is not allowed');\n}\n\nalert(input);\n```\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [programiz](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/while-loop)\n- [launchcode](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/loops/while-loops.html)\n- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)\n"},{"name":"infinite-loops","type":"directory","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","children":[null,{"name":"always-growing.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"always-growing","dir":"3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops/always-growing.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet excitement = 10;\n\nwhile (excitement > 10) {\n  excitement = excitement + 1;\n  console.log(excitement);\n}\n\nconsole.log('all done.');\n"},{"name":"condition-never-changes.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"condition-never-changes","dir":"3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops/condition-never-changes.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet word = 'hello';\n\nwhile (word.length < 10) {\n  word + '!';\n  console.log(word);\n}\n\nconsole.log('all done.');\n"},{"name":"enter-something.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"enter-something","dir":"3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops/enter-something.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet input;\n\nwhile (input !== false) {\n  input = prompt('enter something, not nothing');\n  console.log(input);\n}\n\nconsole.log('all done');\n"},{"name":"step-by-two.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"step-by-two","dir":"3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops/step-by-two.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet x = 0;\n\nwhile (x !== 9) {\n  x = x + 2;\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\nconsole.log('all done.');\n"},{"name":"wrong-way.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"wrong-way","dir":"3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops","path":"/3.2-while-loop/infinite-loops/wrong-way.js","lang":".js","content":"'use strict';\n\nlet x = 0;\n\nwhile (x < 10) {\n  x = x - 1;\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\nconsole.log('all done.');\n"}]},{"name":"study.json","type":"file","ext":".json","base":"study","dir":"3.2-while-loop","path":"/3.2-while-loop/study.json","lang":".json","content":"{\n  \"study\": {\n    \"loopGuard\": {\n      \"active\": true,\n      \"max\": 20\n    }\n  }\n}\n"},{"name":"while-stratetgy-progression","type":"directory","path":"/3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression","children":[{"name":"1-sentinel-value.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"1-sentinel-value","dir":"3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression","path":"/3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression/1-sentinel-value.js","lang":".js","content":"// Sentinel Value: Keep prompting until user enters 'stop'\n\n'use strict';\n\nlet input = '';\nwhile (input !== 'stop') {\n  input = prompt('Enter something (type \"stop\" to finish):');\n}\nalert('You typed stop!');\n"},{"name":"2-counting-iterations.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"2-counting-iterations","dir":"3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression","path":"/3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression/2-counting-iterations.js","lang":".js","content":"// Counting Iterations: Prompt user 3 times\n\n'use strict';\n\nlet count = 0;\nwhile (count < 3) {\n  let entry = prompt('Entry #' + (count + 1));\n  alert('You entered: ' + entry);\n  count = count + 1;\n}\n"},{"name":"3-accumulating-input.js","type":"file","ext":".js","base":"3-accumulating-input","dir":"3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression","path":"/3.2-while-loop/while-stratetgy-progression/3-accumulating-input.js","lang":".js","content":"// Accumulating Input: Concatenate user input until length >= 10\n\n'use strict';\n\nlet text = '';\nwhile (text.length < 10) {\n  let more = prompt('Current: \"' + text + '\".

This quiz will guide you through studying the\n`./cat-detector.js` by zooming in on each language feature used in the program.\n\nEach numbered markdown file in this folder is a quiz question, you can find all\nthe answers in this README if you look carefully. After finding the answer to a\nquestion you should take some time to find that feature in The Cat Detector and\nstudy how it was used.\n\nA good way to take this quiz is in small groups using 3 computers:\n\n1. one computer to open the quiz questions\n2. one computer with this README open as a reference\n3. a third computer with the `./cat-detector.js`\n\nHere are all the language features used in The Cat Detector:\n\n- [Strict Mode](#strict-mode)\n- [Comments](#comments)\n- [Logs](#logs)\n- [Primitives](#primitives)\n  - [Strings](#strings)\n  - [Booleans](#booleans)\n  - [Null](#null)\n- [Operators](#operators)\n  - [Strict Equality](#strict-equality)\n  - [Strict Inequality](#strict-inequality)\n  - [String Concatenation](#string-concatenation)\n  - [Assignment Operator](#assignment-operator)\n- [Variables](#variables)\n  - [Declaring and Initializing](#declaring-and-initializing)\n  - [Reading](#reading)\n  - [Assigning](#assigning)\n  - [Built-In Global Variables](#built-in-global-variables)\n- [User Interactions](#user-interactions)\n  - [Alert](#alert)\n  - [Prompt](#prompt)\n  - [Interactions vs. Logs](#interactions-vs-logs)\n- [Control Flow](#control-flow)\n  - [`if`/`else`](#ifelse)\n  - [`while`](#while)\n- [That's all!](#thats-all)\n\n---\n\n## Strict Mode\n\nThis will be at the top of every program, just ignore it for now. you'll learn\nmore about it later.\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Comments\n\nComments are there to leave notes in the source code for a developer to read.\nThe computer will ignore comments and the user won't know they're there.\n\nYou will come across two kinds of comments:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\n// a single-line (inline) comment\n\n/*\n  a multi-line comment\n  also called a \"block comment\"\n*/\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Logs\n\nlogs print information in the console to help developers understand what\nhappened in the program:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\n// you can log one thing at a time\nconsole.log('hello');\nconsole.log('...');\nconsole.log('good bye');\n\n// or you log more than one thing using commas\nconsole.log('hello', '...', 'good bye');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Primitives\n\nPrograms are all about data: storing it, changing it, showing it to users,\ngetting it from users. Primitives are the basic pieces of data in a JavaScript\nprogram. Each primitive has two important aspects:\n\n- **Type**: There are multiple types, each primitive belongs to only one type.\n  You can think of _types_ as a category like \"fruits\" or \"vegetables\".\n- **Value**: There can be more than one value within each type, just like there\n  are different fruits or different vegetables. (You won't cover these in this\n  module.)\n\nThis diagram might help to see the big picture:\n\n<details>\n<summary>data types diagram</summary>\n<br>\n\n- **Primitive Types**: The basic units of data in a program, like the individual\n  fruits and vegetables when you go shopping.\n- **Composite/Non-Primitive Types**: Structures that _store_ and _organize_\n  data, like the basket you use to carry your groceries.\n\n![data types diagram](../../0-printables/data-types.jpeg)\n\n</details>\n\nThese are the three primitives you will find in The Cat Detector:\n\n---\n\n### Strings\n\nStrings are the type used to store text, every string value must begin and end\nwith quotes:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('this is a string');\nconsole.log('this IS ALSO a \"string\" !!!');\n\n// you can use '\\n' to make a new line inside a string\nconsole.log('line 1 \\nline 2 \\nline 3');\n\n// an empty string, but still a string!\nconsole.log('');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Booleans\n\nBooleans are used the type for yes/no or on/off. There are only two boolean\nvalues, `true` and `false`:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log(true);\nconsole.log(false);\n\n// true/false and the strings 'true'/'false' are not the same thing!\nconsole.log('true');\nconsole.log('false');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Null\n\nNull is a strange thing that you will learn more about later. For now you can\nthink of `null` as the only value in it's own type.\n\nIn The Cat Detector `null` is just used to mean \"nothing\", the user did not\nprovide any data for the program:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log(null);\n\n// null and the string 'null' are not the same thing!\nconsole.log('null');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Operators\n\nOperators combine values to produce a new value. There are many operators in JS,\nbut these are the only ones you need for The Cat Detector:\n\n---\n\n### Strict Equality\n\nThe `_ === _` operator checks if two values have **the same** type _and_ value:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-> strict equality:  ===  ');\n//  checks if two values have the same type AND value\n//  it will evaluate to either true or false\n\n// comparing booleans\nconsole.log(true === true); // true\nconsole.log(true === false); // false\nconsole.log(false === true); // false\nconsole.log(false === false); // true\n\n// strings must be exactly the same for a comparison to be true\nconsole.log('hello' === 'hello'); // true\nconsole.log('hello' === 'HELLO'); // false\n\n// comparing across types is always false\n//  even if they look like they might be the same thing\nconsole.log(null === 'null'); // false\nconsole.log(true === 'true'); // false\nconsole.log(false === 'false'); // false\n\n// it does not matter on which side you put the values\nconsole.log('HELLO' === 'hello'); // false\nconsole.log(null === 'null'); // false\nconsole.log(true === 'true'); // false\nconsole.log(false === 'false'); // false\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Strict Inequality\n\nThe `_ !== _` operator checks if two values have **different** types _or_\nvalues:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-> strict inequality:  !==  ');\n//  checks if two values have different types or value\n//  it will evaluate to either true or false\n//  it's the opposite of strict equality\n\n// comparing booleans\nconsole.log(true !== true); // false\nconsole.log(true !== false); // true\nconsole.log(false !== true); // true\nconsole.log(false !== false); // false\n\n// strings must be exactly the same for a comparison to be true\nconsole.log('hello' !== 'hello'); // false\nconsole.log('hello' !== 'HELLO'); // true\n\n// comparing across types is always false\nconsole.log(null !== 'null'); // true\nconsole.log(true !== 'true'); // true\nconsole.log(false !== 'false'); // true\n\n// it does not matter on which side you put the values\nconsole.log('HELLO' !== 'hello'); // true\nconsole.log('null' !== null); // true\nconsole.log('true' !== true); // true\nconsole.log('false' !== false); // true\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### String Concatenation\n\nThe `_ + _` operator combines two string values into one string value:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-> string concatenation:  +  ');\n// combines multiple strings into a single string\n// the \"trace\" button will help see the difference\n\n// logs the 3 strings separately\nconsole.log('a', 'b', 'c');\n\n// combines 3 strings into 1 string then prints 1 string\n// this happens in two steps:\n//  'a' + 'b' -> 'ab'\n//  'ab' + 'c' -> 'abc'\nconsole.log('a' + 'b' + 'c');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Assignment Operator\n\nThe assignment operator is used to initialize variables (`let _ = _;`) or assign\nthem new values (`_ = _`). You'll study this operator in the next section about\n...\n\n---\n\n## Variables\n\nVariables are [like boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvrszgiexg0) you can\nuse to store data in your programs. (_That video uses `var` but these programs\nuse `let`. For now you can think of them as the same thing._)\n\nThere is a lot to know about variables, but for The Cat Detector you only need\nto know this:\n\n---\n\n### Declaring and Initializing\n\nTo create a new variable in your program you need to _declare_ it using `let`,\nyou cannot use a variable before it is declared.\n\nYou can assign an initial value to a variable when you declare it, this is the\nfirst value that will be stored in your variable:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n![variable diagram](../../0-printables/variable-declare-initialize.jpg)\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- declare and initialize --');\n\n// declare the variable and initialize it's value\nlet userName = 'Joe';\n\n// read the value and log it to the console\nconsole.log(userName); // 'Joe'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Reading\n\nYou can read the value stored in a variable, reading the value _does not_ change\nwhat is stored in the variable:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- reading --');\n\n// declare the variable and initialize it's value\nlet favoriteColor = 'orange';\n// read the value and log it to the console\nconsole.log(favoriteColor); // 'orange'\n\n// read the value from `favoriteColor` and use it to initialize `message`\n//  notice! `favoriteColor` is read BEFORE `message` is initialized\nlet message = 'your favorite color is ' + favoriteColor;\n// read the value from `message` and log it to the console\nconsole.log(message);\n\n// `favoriteColor` still stores the same value:\nconsole.log(favoriteColor);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Assigning\n\nYou can change the value stored in a variable by _assigning_ a new value.\n\nCareful! Variables are _dynamic_, their values can change during program\nexecution. What you see written in the source code may not always be what is\nstored in a variable.\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- assigning --');\n\nlet favoriteColor = 'orange';\nconsole.log(favoriteColor); // 'orange'\n\n// assign a new value to `favoriteColor`\nfavoriteColor = 'blue';\nconsole.log(favoriteColor); // 'blue'\n\nlet message = 'your favorite color is ' + favoriteColor;\n// what value will be logged to the console? why?\nconsole.log(message); // ???\n\n// what value is stored in `favoriteColor`? why?\nconsole.log(favoriteColor); // ???\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Built-In Global Variables\n\nJavaScript programs have some _global variables_ built into the runtime\nenvironment. You can use these variables without declaring them.\n\nThere are many, but you will only encounter 3 of them in these programs:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- global variables --');\n\n// -- console --\n// console is a global variable storing an object\n//  the object contains helpful functions for developers:\nconsole.log(console);\n\n// -- alert --\n// alert is a global variable storing a function\nconsole.log(alert);\n\n// -- prompt --\n// prompt is a global variable storing a function\nconsole.log(prompt);\n\n/*\n  PS. you will learn more about objects and functions later\n    for now this is all you need to know\n*/\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## User Interactions\n\nComputer programs are often written for a user, user-centred applications need\nsome way to communicate with the user. This communication goes two-ways:\n\n- The computer can display information for the user\n- The user can input data for the program to use\n\nIn The Cat Detector you will be find two different user interactions:\n\n---\n\n### Alert\n\nAlert just displays text for the user to read, the user cannot input any data to\nyour program with `alert`.\n\nThe program wil pause until the user clicks \"ok\":\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- alert --');\n\nalert('hello! welcome to this boring program.');\n\nalert('all done.');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Prompt\n\n`prompt` allows a user to input data to your program, they have two options:\n\n- if the user clicks \"ok\", the text they typed will be returned as a string\n- if the user clicks \"cancel\", `null` is returned\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- prompt --');\n\nalert(\n  'hello! welcome to this boring program, run it a few times to learn about `prompt`',\n);\n\n// encourage the user to explore their options\nlet userInput = prompt(\n  'try each of these input combinations:\\n' +\n    '- type something and click \"ok\"\\n' +\n    '- type nothing and click \"ok\"\\n' +\n    '- type something and click \"cancel\"\\n' +\n    '- type nothing and click \"cancel\"\\n',\n);\n\n// log the user's input for the developer to see\nconsole.log(userInput);\n\nalert('check your console to see what data you put into the program.');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Interactions vs. Logs\n\nThere is one more important difference between an interaction (`alert`,\n`prompt`) and `console.log`. Logging to the console will show more information\nabout _types_ and will show from which line the log was printed. This extra\ninformation is very useful to developers but not important for users:\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- interactions vs. logs --');\n\n/* --- different types --- */\n\n// alerting true or 'true' looks exactly the same to a user\nalert(true);\nalert('true');\n\n// logging these values to the console looks different!\n//  also, see the info to the right of these logs in the console?\n//  try clicking on that and seeing what happens\nconsole.log(true);\nconsole.log('true');\n\n/* --- multiple values --- */\n\n// you cannot alert multiple values, users just need one message\nalert('hello', true);\n\n// you can log more than one value, they are all colored differently\n//  this can be very helpful for a developer\nconsole.log('hello', true);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## Control Flow\n\nControl flow is how you can instruct the computer to different things depending\non what data is currently stored in memory. There are only three control flow\nstructures you will need for The Cat Detector:\n\n---\n\n### `if`/`else`\n\nAn `if`/`else` statement allows you to give the computer two possible\ninstructions. One to use if a condition is true, the other if the condition is\nfalse:\n\n1. Evaluate the condition in the parenthesis\n   - If the condition is true, execute the code in the `if` block\n   - Otherwise execute the `else` block\n2. Move on to the next line after the block\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- if/else --');\n\nlet userInput = prompt('please do not cancel');\nconsole.log(userInput);\n\nif (userInput === null) {\n  // this code is executed if the user canceled\n  alert('you canceled :(');\n} else {\n  // this code is executed if the user clicks \"ok\"\n  alert('thank you for your input: ' + userInput);\n}\n\nalert('all done!');\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### `while`\n\nA `while` statement will repeat a block of code _as long as_ the condition is\ntrue:\n\n1. Evaluate the condition in the parenthesis\n   - If the condition is true, execute the code in the block\n   - Otherwise skip to step 2 without executing the block\n2. Move on to the next line after the block\n\n<details>\n<summary>example code</summary>\n<br>\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nconsole.log('-- while --');\n\nlet userInput = null;\n\nwhile (userInput === null) {\n  userInput = prompt('do not cancel, there is no escape');\n  console.log(userInput);\n}\n\nalert('thank you for your input: ' + userInput);\n```\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## That's

Behavior, Strategy, Implementation\n\n3 different ways to understand the same program.\n\n<br/>\n\n![Behavior, Strategy, Implementation Tree](./behavior-strategy-implementation.excalidraw.svg)\n\n<br/>\n\n## Behavior\n\nWhat does the program do? What are it’s inputs and it’s outputs? How does a uers interact\nwith it? Behavior is all about what your program looks like \"from the outside\", without\nlooking at a single line of code.\n\nProgram behavior can be described with a **user story**, **acceptance criteria**, and\n**input/output pairs** (_or_ **test cases**). Here are some examples describing the behavior\nof a `reverses-string.js` program:\n\n```js\n/*\n  -- USER STORY --\n  a user can input a non-empty string and only the letters will be turned into a mirror\n    -- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA --\n    - given the user cancels, they will be prompted again\n    - given the input is empty, they will be prompted again\n    - given their input is valid, the loop will exit and the mirrored letters will be displayed\n  \n  -- INPUT/OUTPUT PAIRS --\n  test cases:\n    only letters:\n      'abc' -> 'abc|cba'\n      'hello' -> 'hello|olleh'\n      'JavaScript' -> 'JavaScript|tpircSavaJ'\n    only not-letters:\n      '.(-).' -> '|'\n      '-=>|<=-' -> '|'\n      '. - ^ - .' -> '|'\n    mixed letters and not-letters:\n      'hello!' -> 'hello|olleh'\n      'good bye?' -> 'goodbye|eybdoog'\n      'let input = \"\"' -> 'letinput|tupnitel'\n*/\n```\n\n## Strategy\n\nHow do you approach solving the problem? There are many strategies to solve the same\nproblem! A way to practice strategy is to think of transforming the arguments to the\nreturn value in small steps, _focusing on the data not the code_. This is the realm of\nflow charts, diagrams, and pseudo-code.\n\nOne way to approach strategy is to solve the problem a few different ways by hand, writing\nwhat you expect to change in memory at each step. Like if you were the debugger and you\ncouldn't see the source code. Using a pencil and paper is a the best way to go, pick a few\ntest cases and see how you'd solve them manually.\n\nHere are three possible strategies to approach mirroring a string. Each one is written as\nstep-by-step goals focusing on _what_ should happen at each step, not _how_ it will\nhappen. This type of comment is helpful to include in your code:\n\n### Reverse & Concatenate: _Strategy_\n\n```js\n// 1. get a string from the user\n// 2. create a new reversed copy of the strings\n// 3. combine the original string with the mirror string\n// 4. display the mirrored string to the user\n```\n\n### Iterate Backwards: _Strategy_\n\n```js\n// 1. get a string from the user\n// 2. create a string with only the \"|\" character\n// 3. iterate backwards over the string\n//\t\ta. append each character on both sides of the new string\n// 4. display the mirrored string to the user\n```\n\n### Reverse & Iterate: _Strategy_\n\n```js\n// 1. get a string from the user\n// 2. create a new reversed copy of the string\n// 3. create a string with only the \"|\" character\n// 4. iterate forwards over the reversed string\n// \t\ta. append each character to either side of the new string\n// 5. display the mirrored string to the user\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nWhich language features and which lines of code did you use to code your strategy? There\nare many ways to implement the same strategy, and no single right answer! A good\nimplementation should be simple and clear, and help readers understand your strategy by\nusing helpful white space, variable names and comments (when necessary).\n\nBelow are 2 different implementations of each strategy described above, and some\ndiscussion questions:\n\n- Which implementation(s) do you think are the easiest to understand?\n- Do you think more comments are helpful or distracting?\n- Do you think long variables names are more helpful or distracting?\n- Which implementation do you think is better, and why?\n- How would you change the code to make it more understandable?\n\n### Reverse & Concatenate: _Implementations_\n\n```js\n// 1. get a string from the user\nlet input = null;\nwhile (input === null) {\n  input = prompt('enter something');\n}\n\n// 2. create a new reversed copy of the strings\nlet reversed = '';\nfor (let nextChar of input) {\n  reversed = nextChar + reversed;\n}\n\n// 3. combine the original string with the mirror string\nlet mirrorederorrim = input + '|' + reversed;\n\n// 4. display the mirrored string to the user\nalert(mirrorederorrim);\n```\n\n```js\n// get a string from the users\nlet toMirror = null;\nwhile (toMirror === null) {\n  toMirror = prompt('Enter some text, it will be mirrored.');\n}\n\n// create a new backwards string\nlet mirrored = '';\nfor (let nextChar of toMirror) {\n  // move each character from the end to the beginning\n  mirrored = nextChar + mirrored;\n}\n\n// display your mirrorized string\nalert('Here is your mirrored text: ' + toMirror + '|' + mirrored);\n```\n\n### Iterate Backwards: _Implementations_\n\n```js\n// 1. get a string from the user\nlet input = null;\nwhile (input === null) {\n  input = prompt('enter something');\n}\n\n// 2. create a string with only the \"|\" character\nlet mirrored = '|';\n\n// 3. iterate backwards over the string\nlet index = input.length - 1;\nwhile (index >= 0) {\n  // a. append each character on both sides of the new string\n  let nextChar = input[index];\n  mirrored = nextChar + mirrored + nextChar;\n  index = index - 1;\n}\n\n// 4. display the mirrored string to the user\nalert(mirrored);\n```\n\n```js\nlet input = null;\nwhile (input === null) {\n  input = prompt('enter something');\n}\n\nlet mirrored = '|';\n\nlet count = 1;\nwhile (count <= input.length) {\n  let nextChar = input[input.length -
